<H1>Chapter 14  80386 Real-Address Mode</H1>
<P>
The real-address mode of the 80386 executes object code designed for
execution on 8086, 8088, 80186, or 80188 processors, or for execution in the
real-address mode of an 80286:
<P>
In effect, the architecture of the 80386 in this mode is almost identical
to that of the 8086, 8088, 80186, and 80188. To a programmer, an 80386 in
real-address mode appears as a high-speed 8086 with extensions to the
instruction set and registers. The principal features of this architecture
are defined in 
<A HREF="c02.htm">Chapters 2</A> and 
<A HREF="c03.htm">3</A>.
<P>
This chapter discusses certain additional topics that complete the system
programmer's view of the 80386 in real-address mode:
<UL>
<LI>Address formation.
<LI>Extensions to registers and instructions.
<LI>Interrupt and exception handling.
<LI>Entering and leaving real-address mode.
<LI>Real-address-mode exceptions.
<LI>Differences from 8086.
<LI>Differences from 80286 real-address mode.
</UL>
