The 80386 brings to Intel's line of microprocessors significant advances in
debugging power. The single-step exception and breakpoint exception of
previous processors are still available in the 80386, but the principal
debugging support takes the form of debug registers. The debug registers
support both instruction breakpoints and data breakpoints. Data breakpoints
are an important innovation that can save hours of debugging time by
pinpointing, for example, exactly when a data structure is being
overwritten. The breakpoint registers also eliminate the complexities
associated with writing a breakpoint instruction into a code segment
(requires a data-segment alias for the code segment) or a code segment
shared by multiple tasks (the breakpoint exception can occur in the context
of any of the tasks). Breakpoints can even be set in code contained in ROM.
