<H1>Chapter 3  Applications Instruction Set</H1>
This chapter presents an overview of the instructions which programmers can
use to write application software for the 80386 executing in protected
virtual-address mode. The instructions are grouped by categories of related
functions.
<P>
The instructions not discussed in this chapter are those that are normally
used only by operating-system programmers. Part II describes the operation
of these instructions.
<P>
The descriptions in this chapter assume that the 80386 is operating in
protected mode with 32-bit addressing in effect; however, all instructions
discussed are also available when 16-bit addressing is in effect in
protected mode, real mode, or virtual 8086 mode. For any differences of
operation that exist in the various modes , refer to 
<A HREF="c13.htm">Chapter 13</A>
   ,
<A HREF="c14.htm">Chapter 14</A>
   , or
<A HREF="c15.htm">Chapter 15</A>
   .
<P>
The instruction dictionary in 
<A HREF="c17.htm">Chapter 17</A>
   contains more detailed
descriptions of all instructions, including encoding, operation, timing,
effect on flags, and exceptions.
